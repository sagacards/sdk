# Open Tarot SDK Core

A typescript interface for the open tarot ecosystem. The core module exports ready-to-use methods for all available resources in raw typescript and cache recommendations for each method. It also exposes its internals for those who want to get closer to the metal:

-   "Actors" to communicate directly "canister" APIs
-   Generated bindings for actors
-   Functions to map canister responses into ready-to-use data

## Getting All Tarot NFTs (DAB)
